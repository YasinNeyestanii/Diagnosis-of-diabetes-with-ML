# Hi, I'm Yain Neyestani
- Welcome to my Github repository, it's a Gaussian ML  model repository
# About repository: 
In this repository, I have placed the data used in the model training , and the page of my jupyter notebook, which is the running code of the model training, and the steps are as follows:

- first import libraries
- Data analysis and Graphs
- Gaussian model
- confusion matrix
- improve my model and Bringing the model to 73% accuracy in each model

  # About Dataset :
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes,
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed
on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females
at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.2
From the data set in the (.csv) File We can find several variables, some of them are independent
(several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome).
